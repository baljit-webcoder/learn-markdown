## 🌱 What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and convert it into structured HTML or styled output.

## 📜 A Brief History of Markdown

Markdown was created by **John Gruber** and **Aaron Swartz** in 2004.  
It was designed so that documents could be readable as plain text but easily converted into HTML. It became the standard for GitHub and many modern tools because it focused on **simplicity, readability, and accessibility**.

## 🔁 Markdown vs HTML

| Feature             | Markdown                           | HTML                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Syntax              | Minimal, readable                  | Verbose, with angle brackets        |
| Learning Curve      | Easy for beginners                 | Requires understanding of structure |
| File Type           | `.md`                              | `.html`                             |
| Output              | Clean formatted text               | Full control of styling/layout      |
| Writing Style       | Human-friendly plain text          | Developer-focused markup            |

✅ Markdown is best for **content-focused writing**  
💻 HTML is best for **design + structure-heavy web pages**

## 🧰 Markdown Editors Compared

| Editor       | Type      | Pros                            | Cons                              |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **VS Code**  | Desktop   | Fast, Markdown Preview built-in  | Needs setup for preview extension |
| **Dillinger**| Online    | Live preview, clean UI           | Requires internet                 |
| **StackEdit**| Online    | Google Drive sync, offline mode  | Slightly advanced UI              |
| **Obsidian** | Desktop   | Powerful linking, vault system   | More for notes than documentation |
