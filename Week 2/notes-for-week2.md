# 📘 Week 2: Formatting in Markdown

> "With each style, Markdown elevates your content."

## 🌱 Text Styling in Markdown

Markdown offers simple ways to format text. Learn how to emphasize, strike through, and organize your content for clarity.

---

## 📜 Text Formatting

### **Bold Text**

To make text bold, wrap it in either double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).

```markdown
**This is bold text**
__This is also bold text__
```

### *Italic Text*

For italic text, wrap it in a single asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`).

```markdown
*This is italic text*
_This is also italic text_
```

### ~~Strikethrough Text~~

For strikethrough text, wrap it in double tildes (`~~`).

```markdown
~~This is strikethrought text~~
```

## 🔁 Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules

### Line Breaks

To add a line break, use `two spaces at the end of a line` and press `Enter`.

```markdown
This is the first line.  
This is the second line after a line break.
```

### Horizontal Rule

Create horizontal rules (lines) by using three dashes (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`).
(Horizontal rules help visually separate content sections.)

```markdown
---
***
___
```

## 💡 Escape Characters

Escape characters are used to display Markdown symbols as regular text. To do so, place a backslash (`\`) before the special character.

```markdown
\# This is not a heading
\* This is not italic text
```
